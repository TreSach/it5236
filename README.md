# it5236

This is a simple discussion project I developed through my academic career at Georgia Southern University. Here you will see my finished work by going to the second it5236 folder. It has more than 25 lambda functions along with more than 25 PHP object-oriented classes that handles different kinds of RESTful service requests between the project and the database. Should you view the template provided by the author/creator, Dr. Russell Thackston, go ahead and open the website folder.

Technlogies used: PHP, NodeJS, JSON, HTML5, CSS3, Amazon Web Services, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS RDS Database (not localhost; database is removed for money-saving purposes --> microservices are no longer functional).
